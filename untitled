Trends:
- Urban cities tend to have more people per square feet of land, while rural cities tend to have less people per square feet. Based on this general knowledge and looking at the different plots, there seems to be a higher occurance of uber rides the more population dense the city type. Thus, the urban city type has a greater total number of rides than suburban and rural city types. There is also a greater number of drivers the more population dense the city type, since there has to be more drivers to meet the damand for rides.
- Based on the 'Pyber Ride Sharing Data (2018)' plot, the average fare for a rural city tends to be more expensive than the average fare in a suburban or urban city, with urban city rides being the cheapest. This is most likely due to the distance covered by each ride. The longer distance beetween the pick-up and drop-off location, than the more expensive the ride is. Since urban cities are typically less spread out and buildings are closer together, the average fare per city is generally much cheaper than what you would find in a suburban or rural city.
- Out of the three city types, urban could be the most profitable. Although the average fare per urban city is less than a suburban or rural city, the higher occurance of rides leads to a higher return. In fact, 62.7% of total fares was from urban areas.
